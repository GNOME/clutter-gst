Clutter-GStreamer README
========================

Clutter-GStreamer (clutter-gst) is an integration library for using GStreamer
with Clutter.

Clutter it an open source software library for creating fast, visually
rich and animated graphical user interfaces. It uses OpenGL for drawing
primitives and has multiple backends, allowing its usage on different
platforms.

GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
installing new plug-ins.

Clutter-GStreamer requires:

  GLib >= 2.10.0
  Clutter >= 0.5.0
  GStreamer >= 0.10
